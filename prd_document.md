# RAG Chatbot Prototype Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- Build a functional RAG-based chatbot prototype that can answer questions using uploaded PDF documents as knowledge base
- Implement semantic search capabilities through vector embeddings to provide contextually relevant responses
- Create an intuitive user interface for document upload and chat interactions
- Establish a solid foundation for future enhancements and potential cloud deployment
- Validate the effectiveness of the chosen tech stack (Python, LangChain, FAISS, OpenAI, Streamlit) for RAG applications

### Background Context

The proliferation of internal documents, research papers, and knowledge bases within organizations creates a challenge: how to quickly extract relevant information and insights from vast document collections. Traditional keyword search often falls short when users need nuanced, context-aware answers.

This RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chatbot prototype addresses this need by combining the power of large language models with semantic search capabilities. By embedding PDF documents into a vector database and using semantic similarity for retrieval, the system can provide more intelligent, context-aware responses than traditional search methods. The local-first approach allows for rapid prototyping, testing, and iteration without cloud infrastructure concerns.

## Requirements

### Functional

- FR1: The system must allow users to upload multiple PDF documents through the Streamlit interface
- FR2: The system must extract text content from uploaded PDF documents and process them for embedding
- FR3: The system must generate vector embeddings for document chunks using OpenAI's embedding models
- FR4: The system must store vector embeddings in a FAISS vector database for efficient similarity search
- FR5: The system must provide a chat interface where users can ask natural language questions
- FR6: The system must perform semantic search against the vector database to retrieve relevant document chunks
- FR7: The system must use retrieved chunks as context for LLM generation to provide accurate, source-grounded answers
- FR8: The system must display chat history and maintain conversation context within a session
- FR9: The system must indicate which source documents were used to generate each response
- FR10: The system must handle common PDF formats and extract text reliably

### Non Functional

- NFR1: The system must run entirely on local infrastructure without requiring cloud services beyond OpenAI API calls
- NFR2: Response time for chat queries should be under 10 seconds for typical document collections
- NFR3: The system must handle PDF documents up to 50MB in size
- NFR4: The system must support concurrent usage by a single user with multiple chat sessions
- NFR5: The system must gracefully handle API rate limits and connection errors with OpenAI services
- NFR6: The vector database must persist between application sessions
- NFR7: The system must provide clear error messages for unsupported file formats or processing failures

## User Interface Design Goals
